**Maintainers**: Stephen Bothwell and Abigail Swenor

## Summary

This is a repository for the LT4HALA 2024 workshop paper, **"Nostra Domina at EvaLatin 2024: Improving Latin Polarity Detection through Data Augmentation."** 
This work participated in the EvaLatin 2024 shared task on emotion polarity detection (Sprugnoli, Iurescia, and Passarotti, 2024).

Our repository includes:
- the automatically-annotated data generated as a part of the paper (see `data/polarity/training`) 
- the tools applied to generate and process that data, including the novel polarity coordinate clustering method (see `gaussian_annotator.py`, `polarity_annotator.py`, and `polarity_splitter.py`)
- the process used to train and tune neural networks on this data (see `polarity_detector.py` and `trial_generator.py`)
- the tools employed to analyze and visualize the results of our methods on EvaLatin 2024's test data (see `polarity_scorer.py`, `results_comparer.py`, and `results_visualizer.py`).
We describe the contents of this repository in more detail below, and we highlight our available CLIs as well as any additional information that may be helpful in reproducing our experiments.

## Contents

The repository contains a few main directories:
- `data`: a collection of data related to polarity detection; 
the data created through the study is given as a part of this repository in the subdirectories of `training/annotated`.
- `models`: a default location for models trained by `polarity_detector.py`.
- `predictions`: a collection of model predictions submitted to the EvaLatin 2024 shared task for polarity detection. 
The predictions are presented in the format expected by the scoring tool given by the organizers (see each `scorer` subdirectory) subdirectories 
as well as a format which resembles the original presentation of the data (see each `full` subdirectory).
- `resources`: a collection of external resources (usually pretrained models) for use in various tools (i.e., `gaussian_annotator.py` and `polarity_detector.py`).
- `results`: a default location for the results of training, validation, and testing produced by `polarity_detector.py`.
- `utils`: a collection of code organized into a variety of subdirectories and used by the variety of CLIs presented in the top level of this repository.

The repository mainly revolves around the CLIs present at its top level. 
The CLIs themselves are presented alongside descriptions of them and notes toward reproducing our work.
The below is further divided into three subsections regarding the initial data creation and dataset splitting (Data) 
and the hyperparameter tuning, 
the training and evaluation of neural networks (Modeling),
and the examination and visualization of model predictions (Results).

To reproduce our work, some data not innately included in our repository needs to be gathered. 
Links and references to all this data are present in `.gitkeep` files spread throughout the `data` and `resources` directories. 
An item's presence in a `.gitkeep` file indicates that it should be placed at that location. 
The `__init__.py` files under `utils/data/loaders` and `utils/layers/embeddings` provide indications on default filepaths for various elements of our data and pretrained embeddings, respectively.

### Data

In this section, we present our annotation tools (`gaussian_annotator.py`, `polarity_annotator.py`) as well as our data splitter (`polarity_splitter.py`). 

#### Gaussian Annotator

For our Gaussian annotator, we provide the CLI below:

```
>>> python gaussian_annotator.py -h
usage: gaussian_annotator.py [-h] [--components COMPONENTS] [--embedding-filepath EMBEDDING_FILEPATH] [--input-filepath [INPUT_FILEPATH]] [--lexicon-filepath LEXICON_FILEPATH]
                             [--output-filename OUTPUT_FILENAME] [--output-filepath [OUTPUT_FILEPATH]] [--report | --no-report] [--random-seed RANDOM_SEED]
                             [--random-seeds RANDOM_SEEDS] [--save-filepath SAVE_FILEPATH] [--seed-filepath SEED_FILEPATH]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --components COMPONENTS
                        number of distributions (i.e., classes) the Gaussian Mixture Model will incorporate
  --embedding-filepath EMBEDDING_FILEPATH
                        filepath to file or directory containing embedding data; currently only supports word2vec or SPhilBERTa
  --input-filepath [INPUT_FILEPATH]
                        filepath to directory containing data to annotate
  --lexicon-filepath LEXICON_FILEPATH
                        filepath to sentiment lexicon
  --output-filename OUTPUT_FILENAME
                        name of file where newly-annotated data will be stored; does not require file extension
  --output-filepath [OUTPUT_FILEPATH]
                        filepath to a directory where newly-annotated data will be stored
  --report, --no-report
                        a flag indicating whether the annotator should report numerical results regarding the data or not (default: False)
  --random-seed RANDOM_SEED
                        a flag indicating the random seed which controls the general procedure
  --random-seeds RANDOM_SEEDS
                        the number of random seeds used to generate initial random states for the Gaussian mixture Model
  --save-filepath SAVE_FILEPATH
                        filepath to location where Gaussian Mixture Model will be saved
  --seed-filepath SEED_FILEPATH
                        filepath to labeled data used for training the Gaussian Mixture Model
```

The Gaussian annotator tool performs a hyperparameter search for the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) similar to the one performed during our experiments. 
We ran a total of 120 trials with the following hyperparameters and ranges:

- **Covariance Matrix Type**: diagonal (`diag`), full, spherical, tied
- **Initialization Method**: k-means, k-means++, random-from-data (`random_from_data`)

Each trial had ten different random initializations, and ten different random states were used to control this process. 
We raised the covariance regularization constant to .00001 to prevent the matrix from having negative values on the diagonal. 
All trials ran for up to 100 iterations. 
Due to size of the *Odes* dataset size, trials were both trained and evaluated on that set for their Macro-F1 score; 
the best GMM, having a tied covariance matrix and being initialized with the k-means algorithm, scored 0.37.

For the dataset produced with this work, we applied all defaults save that we set `--embedding-filepath` to point to `resources/sphilberta`, 
applying SPhilBERTa embeddings (Riemenschneider and Frank, 2023b) with polarity coordinate features attached.

#### Polarity Coordinate Annotator

For the polarity coordinate annotator, we provide the CLI below:

```
python polarity_annotator.py -h
usage: polarity_annotator.py [-h] [--input-filepath INPUT_FILEPATH] [--lexicon-filepath LEXICON_FILEPATH] [--output-filename OUTPUT_FILENAME] [--output-filepath OUTPUT_FILEPATH]
                             [--lexicon-sensitive | --no-lexicon-sensitive] [--report | --no-report]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input-filepath INPUT_FILEPATH
                        filepath to directory containing data to annotate
  --lexicon-filepath LEXICON_FILEPATH
                        filepath to sentiment lexicon
  --output-filename OUTPUT_FILENAME
                        name of file where newly-annotated data will be stored; does not require file extension
  --output-filepath OUTPUT_FILEPATH
                        filepath to a directory where newly-annotated data will be stored
  --lexicon-sensitive, --no-lexicon-sensitive
                        flag which determines whether only words in the sentiment lexicon are taken into account for computing polarity coordinates (default: False)
  --report, --no-report
                        a flag indicating whether the annotator should report numerical results regarding the data or not (default: False)
```

For the dataset produced with this work, we used the `--lexicon-sensitive` flag. All else was set to its defaults.

#### Polarity Splitter

For our data splitting, we used the CLI given below:

```
>>> python polarity_splitter.py -h        
usage: polarity_splitter.py [-h] [--input-file INPUT_FILE] [--names NAMES [NAMES ...]] [--output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [--random-seed RANDOM_SEED]
                            [--ratios RATIOS [RATIOS ...]] [--strategy {random}]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input-file INPUT_FILE
                        filepath of the file to be partitioned into designated data splits
  --names NAMES [NAMES ...]
                        names of the data splits to be created; these must match the number of ratios given
  --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                        directory where data splits will be saved
  --random-seed RANDOM_SEED
                        a flag indicating the random seed which controls the general procedure
  --ratios RATIOS [RATIOS ...]
                        decimals representing the percentages of data composing each split; these must sum to 1, and the number of splits must match the number of names
  --strategy {random}   the algorithm used to create the data splits
```

We used the default values across the board for our data splitting procedures, 
save that we changed the file locations according to the annotation result that we were dealing with at the moment.

### Modeling

In this section, we present our neural network trainer and evaluator (`polarity_detector.py`) and our hyperparameter search script creator (`trial_generator.py`).

#### Polarity Detector

First, we provide the overall interface for the polarity detector. 
This interface hides most of its argument behind the `mode`---that is, the manner in which the detector is going to be used.
By doing this, certain arguments are locked to certain uses of the detector, and any incorrectly-applied arguments will throw errors upon being used.

```
>>> python polarity_detector.py -h
usage: polarity_detector.py [-h] {train,evaluate,predict} ...
                                                             
options:                                                     
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

mode:
  {train,evaluate,predict}
```

Then, we provide the interface for the `train` mode:

```

#### Trial Generator

The interface to our hyperparameter search trial generator is given below. 
Currently, it only supports performing a random search. It assures that duplicate trials are not chosen, 
but it otherwise does not intervene on the trial generation in any way.

```
>>> python trial_generator.py -h

  --seed SEED           a flag indicating the random seed which controls the general procedure
  --specified [SPECIFIED ...]
                        hyperparameter names and values which will be fixed across all trials
  --trials TRIALS       number of hyperparameter trials to generate
  --trial-start-offset TRIAL_START_OFFSET

  --varied [{batch-size,bidirectional,dataset,embedding,encoder,epochs,frozen-embeddings,heads,hidden-size,layers,learning-rate,loss-function,patience,random-seed} ...]
                        hyperparameters which will be varied across all trials

```

For our experiments, we ran sets of 4 trials across a variety of scenarios. In particular, we ran variations on the following model components:
- **Embeddings**: Latin BERT (Bamman and Burns 2020), LaBERTa (Riemenschneider and Frank, 2023a), PhilBERTa (Riemenschneider and Frank, 2023a), SPhilBERTa (Riemenschneider and Frank, 2023b), mBERT (Devlin *et al.*, 2019), CANINE-C (Clark *et al.*, 2022), CANINE-S (Clark *et al.*, 2022)
- **Encoders**: Identity, BiLSTM, Transformer
- **Loss Functions**: Cross-Entropy, Gold Distance-Weighted Cross Entropy
- **Datasets**: Polarity Coordinate, Gaussian

Note that not all combinations were used. Namely, SPhilBERTa, capturing sentence-level rather than word-level representations, 
uses only the Identity encoder. Moreover, the same embedding was not applied with the Gaussian dataset, as it was used to train the GMM which generated that dataset. 
Finally, the Gold Distance-Weighted Cross Entropy loss is only used with the Polarity Coordinate data, as the Gaussian data has no such measure of "distance" to use.

During these trials, we varied the learning rate, the hidden size (when applicable), and number of encoder layers (when applicable). 
Their ranges were as follows:
- **Hidden Size**: {64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024}
- **Layers**: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- **Learning Rate**: {1e-05, 2e-05, 3e-05, 4e-05, 5e-05, 6e-05, 7e-05, 8e-05, 9e-05, 1e-04, 2e-04, 3e-04, 4e-04, 5e-04, 6e-04, 7e-04, 8e-04, 9e-04, 1e-03, 2e-03, 3e-03, 4e-03, 5e-03, 6e-03, 7e-03, 8e-03, 9e-03, 1e-02}

These ranges were selected based upon a mixture of previous experience and in consulting related work. 
To elaborate further, the hidden size range consists of all powers of 2 from 2\*\*6 and 2\*\*10 alongside each average of each pair of successively larger powers of 2. 
The learning rate range contains progressively longer intervals between learning rates, starting with 1e-05 to 9e-05 (in steps of 1e-05), following that with 1e-04 to 9e-04 (in steps of 1e-04), following that with 1e-03 to 9e-03 (in steps of 1e-03), and concluding with 1e-02.
This range is an attempt to keep the number of possible learning rates low while covering a decent range and including ones found in related works.

Regarding the learning rate range, there was a mild mistake in the code which caused 1e-04 and 1e-03 appeared twice. 
This made them slightly more likely to appear than the other values.
To allow our experiments to be reduplicated exactly, we did not correct this. 
However, extensions of this code should be aware of it so that they may correct or incorporate it as they wish.

### Results

In this section, we present our scorer for the results of the emotion polarity detection task (`polarity_scorer.py`), 
our comparer for our Gaussian clustering model and our neural models, and our visualizer for our classification task results (`results_visualizer.py`). 
Although the organizers provided a scorer for results, we created an additional one to compute further statistics.

#### Polarity Scorer

This interface to our polarity scorer is given below. 
Note that this interface is largely tailored to the scoring format given by the EvaLatin 2024 shared task organizers. 
Moreover, its subsets are restricted to those given in the test set of the shared task.
However, it can be used on other directories or files of TSV data in the same format.
It computes and displays Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 scores across the selected and filtered files.

```
>>> python polarity_scorer.py -h
usage: polarity_scorer.py [-h] --input-filepath INPUT_FILEPATH [--subsets [{Orazio,Pontano,Seneca} ...]]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input-filepath INPUT_FILEPATH
                        path to file or directory containing .tsv files as designated by EvaLatin 2024's emotion polarity detection task
  --subsets [{Orazio,Pontano,Seneca} ...]
                        subsets of the EvaLatin 2024 emotion polarity detection test set to exclusively evaluate on; all available documents are used if no subsets are given
```

Note that the scores produced by this tool may not match the scores of the organizers when applied to the full dataset, 
as such scores proceed through additional averaging steps.

#### Results Comparer

The interface for our results comparer is given below. Currently, it is only meant to function with a Gaussian model, whose classifications are derived on-the-fly, 
and some other model whose predictions have been outputted to EvaLatin's standardized TSV format.
This interface displays both the Macro-F1 score for the Gaussian model and Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960) for the pair of models, accounting for chance agreement.

```

usage: results_comparer.py [-h] [--embedding-filepath EMBEDDING_FILEPATH] [--lexicon-filepath LEXICON_FILEPATH] [--model-filepath MODEL_FILEPATH]

  --model-filepath MODEL_FILEPATH
                        filepath to a trained Gaussian Mixture Model from scikit-learn for the emotion polarity detection task
  --predictions-directory PREDICTIONS_DIRECTORY

  --test-directory TEST_DIRECTORY
                        path to directory where EvaLatin-style TSV data is contained
```

#### Results Visualizer

This interface outputs or displays a confusion matrix for a set of one or more files in the scoring format given by the EvaLatin 2024 shared task organizers.
Currently, most of the stylistic attributes of the confusion matrix heatmap are predefined and not able to be altered in the interface.

The treebank is obtained from the automated conversion of the Late Latin Charter Treebank 2 (LLCT2), originally in the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) style. As this treebank consists of Early Medieval legal documents, its language variety differs considerably from both the Classical and Medieval learned varieties prevalent in the other currently available UD Latin treebanks. Consequently, besides significant phenomena from the perspective of diachronic linguistics, this treebank also poses several challenging technical issues for the current and future syntactic annotation of Latin in the UD framework. Some of the most relevant cases are discussed in depth, with comparisons between the original PDT and the resulting UD annotations. Additionally, an overview of the UD-style structure of the treebank is given, and some diachronic aspects of the transition from Latin to Romance languages are highlighted.},

In particular, we motivate the choice of using the technique of treebank embeddings in light of the characteristics of mathematical texts.

Finally, the results of the parsing are discussed in comparison to a baseline and the most prominent errors are discussed. Overall, the paper shows the added value of creating specific training data, and of using targeted strategies (as treebank embeddings) to exploit existing annotated corpora while preserving the features of one specific text when performing syntactic parsing.},

More specifically, the training set includes only prose texts of the Classical period, whereas the test set is organized in three sub-tasks: a Classical sub-task on a prose text of an author not included in the training data, a Cross-genre sub-task on poetic and scientific texts, and a Cross-time sub-task on a text of the 15th century. The results obtained by the participants for each task and sub-task are presented and discussed.},

While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all languages, and the use of any fixed vocabulary may limit a model's ability to adapt. In this paper, we present Canine, a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences{\textemdash}without explicit tokenization or vocabulary{\textemdash}and a pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias. To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, Canine combines downsampling, which reduces the input sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes context. Canine outperforms a comparable mBert model by 5.7 F1 on TyDi QA, a challenging multilingual benchmark, despite having fewer model parameters.}

  abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {Recent advances in NLP have led to the creation of powerful language models for many languages including Ancient Greek and Latin. While prior work on Classical languages unanimously uses BERT, in this work we create four language models for Ancient Greek that vary along two dimensions to study their versatility for tasks of interest for Classical languages: we explore (i) encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures using RoBERTa and T5 as strong model types, and create for each of them (ii) a monolingual Ancient Greek and a multilingual instance that includes Latin and English. We evaluate all models on morphological and syntactic tasks, including lemmatization, which demonstrates the added value of T5's decoding abilities. We further define two probing tasks to investigate the knowledge acquired by models pre-trained on Classical texts. Our experiments provide the first benchmarking analysis of existing models of Ancient Greek. Results show that our models provide significant improvements over the SoTA. The systematic analysis of model types can inform future research in designing language models for Classical languages, including the development of novel generative tasks. We make all our models available as community resources, along with a large curated pre-training corpus for Ancient Greek, to support the creation of a larger, comparable model zoo for Classical Philology.}
